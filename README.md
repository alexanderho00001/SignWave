# SignWave – Learn ASL with AI

natHACKS 2025 Submission
Team: The She-Coders With A He

# Project Overview

SignWave is an interactive web-based platform that helps users learn American Sign Language (ASL) through real-time feedback powered by AI and machine learning. Using computer vision, users sign into their webcam and receive instant feedback on accuracy and gesture clarity.

# Device Concept

AI-Powered Feedback: Uses pre-trained models to detect and classify hand gestures.

Lessons: Learn the ASL alphabet, numbers, and basic vocabulary.

Mini-Games: Practice with gamified challenges—sign falling prompts, multiplayer sign battles, and more.

Progress Tracking: Automatically saves learning progress for continuous development.

# How It Works

First, open the website and allow webcam access, and choose a lesson to begin learning ASL. 
Follow the on-screen prompt and perform hand signs. 
Use the "Reveal Answer" button if you do not know the sign. 
Play games with others to test your skill.
